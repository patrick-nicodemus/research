For any bicategory B, we describe a tricategory of B- indexeded bicategories which are the weakest possible generalization of pseudofunctors to the immediate next level. Then we introduce a notion of a fibration of bicategories, which generalizes 2-fibrations of strict 2-categories defined by Hermida. Finally we give an explicit construction of an analog of the Grothendieck construction which provides a triequivalence between the 3-category of B-indexeded bicategories and the 3-category of 2-fibrations over B.}

That looks like a composite resolution; first an algebra is  resolved by means of free modules (over the ground ring) and then this resolution is given the structure of a DG-algebra and resolved by the categorical bar resolution. This suggests that similar results might be obtained for all categories of objects with "two structures". Not surprisingly this turns out to involve a coherence condition between the structures which,for ordinary algebras, turns out to reduce to the  distributive law. It was suggested in this connection by J. Beck and H. Appelgate.},

Another possibility is that it be homotopic to a constant simplicial object. Despite claims in the literature to the contrary, we show that all three are distinct concepts with strong extra degeneracy implies extra degeneracy implies homotopic to a constant and give explicit examples to show the converses fail.},

  abstract = {In ordinary homological algebra, if M is an R-module, the usual way of starting to construct a projective resolution of M is to let F be the free R-module generated by the elements of M and F -* M the epimorphism determined by (m) -+ m . One then takes the kernel of F -* M and continues the process. But notice that in the construction of F -+ M a lot of structure is customarily overlooked. F is actually a functor MG of M , F -+ M is an instance of a natural transformation G -+ (identity functor) ; there is also a "comultiplication" G -+ GG which is a little less evident. The functor G , equipped with these structures, is an example of what is called a standard construction or "cotriple". In this paper we start with a category C, , a cotriple 6 in C. , and show how resolutions and derived functors or homology can be constructed by means of this tool alone. The category C. will be non-abelian in general (note that even for modules the cotriple employed fails to respect the additive structure of the category), and the coefficients will consist of an arbitrary functor E : C. -+ Q. where \& is an abelian category. For ordinary homology and cohomology theories, E will be tensoring, homming or deriving with or into a module of some kind. To summarize the contents of the paper: In § 1 we define the derived functors and give several examples of categories with cotriples. In § 2 we study the derived functors H ( »E)\textasciicircum{} as functors on C, and give several of their properties. In § 3 we fix a first variable X e C. and study H (X, ) as a functor of the abelian variable E . As such it admits a simple axiomatic characterization. § 4 considers the case in which C. is additive and shows that the general theory can always, in effect, be reduced to that case. In § 5 we study the relation between cotriples and projective classes (defined - essentially - by Eilenberg-Moore [ 16 ]) and show that the  homology only depends on the projective class defined by the cotriple. §§ 6-9 are concerned largely with various special properties that these derived functors possess in well known algebraic categories (groups, modules, algebras, ....). In § 10 we consider the problem of defining a cotriple to produce a given projective class (in a sense, the converse problem to that studied in § 5) by means of "models". We also compare the results with other theories of derived functors based on models. § 11 is concerned with some technical items on acyclic models.},

When R is a field, the six collapse to three and are well-known, at least to folklore, but in the general case the new relative and mixed model structures offer interesting alternatives to the model structures in common use. The construction of some of these model structures requires two new variants of the small object argument, an enriched and an algebraic one, and we describe these more generally. In Part 2, we present a variety of theoretical and calculational cofibrant approximations in these model categories. The classical bar construction gives cofibrant approximations in the relative model structure, but generally not in the usual one. In the usual model structure, there are two quite different ways to lift cofibrant approximations from the level of homology modules over homology algebras, where they are classical projective resolutions, to the level of DG-modules over DG-algebras. The new theory makes model theoretic sense of earlier explicit calculations based on one of these constructions. A novel phenomenon we encounter is isomorphic cofibrant approximations with different combinatorial structure such that things proven in one avatar are not readily proven in the other.},

From the point of view of "triples," a distributive law provides a way of interchanging two types of operations and making the functorial composition of two triples into a more complex triple. The main formal properties and different ways of looking at distributive laws are given in §1. §2 is about algebras over composite triples. These are found to be objects with two structures, and the distributive law or interchange of operations appears in its usual form as an equation which the two types of operations must obey. §3 is about some frequently-occurring diagrams of adjoint functors which are connected with distributive laws. §4 is devoted to Examples. There is an Appendix on compositions of adjoint functors.},

In §2 we show how to obtain a cohomology theory from an adjoint pair of functors. In §3, when the adjoint pair is tripleable, we prove that the cohomology group H1 classifies principal homogeneous objects. When coefficients are in a module, principal objects are interpreted as algebra extensions. §4 is devoted to examples. Many categories occurring in algebra are shown to be tripleable. The corresponding cohomology and extension theories, ranging from groups and algebras to the classical Ext(A, C), are discussed. Many new theories arise. A method for proving coincidence of triple cohomology with certain standard theories has been given by [Barr \& Beck (1966)]. That paper contains a summary of the present work.},

In this thesis we study constructions of cocomplete tensor categories (resp. cocontinuous tensor functors) which usually correspond to constructions of schemes (resp. their morphisms) in the case of quasi-coherent sheaves. This means to globalize the usual local-global algebraic geometry. For this we first have to develop basic commutative algebra in an arbitrary cocomplete tensor category. We then discuss tensor categorical globalizations of affine morphisms, projective morphisms, immersions, classical projective embeddings (Segre, Plu¨cker, Veronese), blow-ups, fiber products, classifying stacks and finally tangent bundles. It turns out that the universal properties of several moduli spaces or stacks translate to the corresponding tensor categories.},

  abstract = {Notions of generalized multicategory have been defined in numerous con- texts throughout the literature, and include such diverse examples as symmetric multi- categories, globular operads, Lawvere theories, and topological spaces. In each case, generalized multicategories are defined as the “lax algebras” or “Kleisli monoids” rela- tive to a “monad” on a bicategory. However, the meanings of these words differ from author to author, as do the specific bicategories considered. We propose a unified frame- work: by working with monads on double categories and related structures (rather than bicategories), one can define generalized multicategories in a way that unifies all previous examples, while at the same time simplifying and clarifying much of the theory.}

We introduce the knowledge refactoring problem, where the goal is to restructure a learner's knowledge base to reduce its size and to minimise redundancy in it. We focus on inductive logic programming, where the knowledge base is a logic program. We introduce Knorf, a system which solves the refactoring problem using constraint optimisation. A key feature of Knorf is that, rather than simply removing knowledge, it also introduces new knowledge through predicate invention. We evaluate our approach on two domains: building Lego structures and real-world string transformations. Our experiments show that learning from refactored knowledge can improve predictive accuracies fourfold and reduce learning times by half.},

  abstract = {As functions which further the state of a proof in automated theorem proving, tactics are an important development in automated deduction. This thesis describes a method to tackle the problem of tactic formation. Tactics must currently be developed by hand, which can be a complicated and time-consuming process. A method is presented for the automatic production of useful tactics. The method presented works on the principle that commonly occurring patterns within proof corpora may have some significance and could therefore be exploited to provide novel tactics. These tactics are discovered using a three step process. Firstly a suitable corpus is chosen and processed. One example of a suitable corpus is that of the Isabelle theorem prover. A number of possible abstractions are presented for this corpus. Secondly, machine learning techniques are used to data-mine each corpus and find sequences of commonly occurring proof steps. The specifics of a proof step are defined by the specified abstraction. The formation of these tactics is completed using evolutionary techniques to combine these patterns into compound tactics. These new tactics are applied using a naive prover as well as undergoing manual evaluation. The tactics show favourable results across a selection of tests, justifying the claim that this project provides a novel method of automatically producing tactics which are both viable and useful},

  abstract = {This paper is an introduction to the theory of “model categories”, which was devel- oped by Quillen in [22] and [23]. By definition a model category is just an ordinary category with three specified classes of morphisms, called fibrations, cofibrations and weak equivalences, which satisfy a few simple axioms that are deliberately rem- iniscent of properties of topological spaces. Surprisingly enough, these axioms give a reasonably general context in which it is possible to set up the basic machinery of homotopy theory. The machinery can then be used immediately in a large number of different settings, as long as the axioms are checked in each case. Although many of these settings are geometric (spaces (§8), fibrewise spaces (3.11), G-spaces [11], spectra [5], diagrams of spaces [10] . . .), some of them are not (chain complexes (§7), simplicial commutative rings [24], simplicial groups [23] . . .). Certainly each setting has its own technical and computational peculiarities, but the advantage of an abstract approach is that they can all be studied with the same tools and described in the same language. What is the suspension of an augmented commuta- tive algebra? One of incidental appeals of Quillen’s theory (to a topologist!) is that it both makes a question like this respectable and gives it an interesting answer (11.3). We have tried to minimize the prerequisites needed for understanding this pa- per; it should be enough to have some familiarity with CW-complexes, with chain complexes, and with the basic terminology associated with categories. Almost all of the material we present is due to Quillen [22], but we have replaced his treatment of suspension functors and loop functors by a general construction of homotopy pushouts and homotopy pullbacks in a model category. What we do along these lines can certainly be carried further. This paper is not in any sense a survey of everything that is known about model categories; in fact we cover only a fraction of the material in [22]. The last section has a discussion of some ways in which model categories have been used in topology and algebra.},

  abstract = {In recent years predicate invention has been underexplored as a bias reformulation mechanism within Inductive Logic Programming due to difficulties in formulating efficient search mechanisms. However, recent papers on a new approach called Meta-Interpretive Learning have demonstrated that both predicate invention and learning recursive predicates can be efficiently implemented for various fragments of definite clause logic using a form of abduction within a meta-interpreter. This paper explores the effect of bias reformulation produced by Meta-Interpretive Learning on a series of Program Induction tasks involving string transformations. These tasks have real-world applications in the use of spreadsheet technology. The existing implementation of program induction in Microsoft’s FlashFill (part of Excel 2013) already has strong performance on this problem, and performs one-shot learning, in which a simple transformation program is generated from a single example instance and applied to the remainder of the column in a spreadsheet. However, no existing technique has been demonstrated to improve learning performance over a series of tasks in the way humans do. In this paper we show how a functional variant of the recently developed MetagolD system can be applied to this task. In experiments we study a regime of layered bias reformulation in which size-bounds of hypotheses are successively relaxed in each layer and learned programs re-use invented predicates from previous layers. Results indicate that this approach leads to consistent speed increases in learning, more compact definitions and consistently higher predictive accuracy over successive layers. Comparison to both FlashFill and human performance indicates that the new system, MetagolDF , has performance approaching the skill level of both an existing commercial system and that of humans on one-shot learning over the same tasks. The induced programs are relatively easily read and understood by a human programmer.},

Acquiring expertise means learning these languages -- systems of concepts, alongside the skills to use them. We present DreamCoder, a system that learns to solve problems by writing programs. It builds expertise by creating programming languages for expressing domain concepts, together with neural networks to guide the search for programs within these languages. A ``wake-sleep'' learning algorithm alternately extends the language with new symbolic abstractions and trains the neural network on imagined and replayed problems. DreamCoder solves both classic inductive programming tasks and creative tasks such as drawing pictures and building scenes. It rediscovers the basics of modern functional programming, vector algebra and classical physics, including Newton's and Coulomb's laws. Concepts are built compositionally from those learned earlier, yielding multi-layered symbolic representations that are interpretable and transferrable to new tasks, while still growing scalably and flexibly with experience.},

By enlisting the help of computers mathematicians are able to formally prove more complex results than they perhaps otherwise could, however those computers are still incapable of drawing many of the conclusions which would be obvious to a human user and so human intervention is still required. In this thesis we consider the use of an adapted machine learning technique to begin addressing this issue. We consider the use of proof strategies to provide a high-level view of how a proof is structured, including information about why a particular step was taken. We extend the Metagol meta-interpretive learning tool to facilitate learning these strategies. We begin with a small set of examples and refine our approach, demonstrating the improvements experimentally. We go on to discuss the learning of more complicated strategies, some of the issues faced in doing so and how we could address them. We conclude by evaluating the experiments as a whole, identifying the weak points in our approach and suggesting ways in which they can be addressed in future work.},

In it, the two classes of maps of a w.f.s. are replaced by two categories of maps-with-structure, where the extra structure on a map now encodes a choice of liftings with respect to the other class. This extra structure has pleasant consequences: for example, a natural w.f.s. on C induces a canonical natural w.f.s. structure on any functor category [A, C]. In this paper, we define cofibrantly generated natural weak factorisation systems by analogy with cofibrantly generated w.f.s.’s. We then construct them by a method which is reminiscent of Quillen’s small object argument but produces factorisations which are much smaller and easier to handle, and show that the resultant natural w.f.s. is, in a suitable sense, freely generated by its generating cofibrations. Finally, we show that the two categories of maps-with-structure for a natural w.f.s. are closed under all the constructions we would expect of them: (co)limits, pushouts / pullbacks, transfinite composition, and so on.},

  abstract = {Formal verification is increasingly used in industry. A pop- ular technique is interactive theorem proving, used for instance by Intel in HOL light. The ability to learn and re-apply proof strategies from a small set of proofs would significantly increase the productivity of these systems, and make them more cost-effective to use. Previous learning at- tempts have had limited success, which we believe is a result of missing key goal properties in the strategies. Capturing such properties will re- quire predicate invention, and the only technique we are familiar which supports this is meta-interpretive learning (MIL). We show that MIL is applicable to this problem, but that without type information it of- fers limited improvements in quality over previous work. We then extend MIL with types and give preliminary results indicating that this exten- sion learns better-quality strategies with suitable goal properties.},

In this paper, we present three new improvements to ML4PG. First, a new method of "recurrent clustering" is introduced to collect statistical features from Coq terms. Now the user can receive suggestions about similar definitions, types and lemma statements, in addition to proof strategies. Second, Coq proofs are split into patches to capture proof strategies that could arise at different stages of a proof. Finally, we improve ML4PG's output introducing an automaton-shape representation for proof patterns.},

  abstract = {We present a general semantic account of Gifford-style type-and-effect systems. These type systems provide lightweight static analyses annotating program phrases with the sets of possible computational effects they may cause, such as memory access and modification, exception raising, and non-deterministic choice. The analyses are used, for example, to justify the program transformations typically used in optimising com- pilers, such as code reordering and inlining. Despite their existence for over two decades, there is no prior comprehensive theory of type-and-effect systems accounting for their syntax and semantics, and justifying their use in effect-dependent program transformation. We achieve this generality by recourse to the theory of algebraic effects, a de- velopment of Moggi’s monadic theory of computational effects that emphasises the operations causing the effects at hand and their equational theory. The key observation is that annotation effects can be identified with the effect operations. Our first main contribution is the uniform construction of semantic models for type- and-effect analysis by a process we call conservative restriction. Our construction re- quires an algebraic model of the unannotated programming language and a relevant notion of predicate. It then generates a model for Gifford-style type-and-effect anal- ysis. This uniform construction subsumes existing ad-hoc models for type-and-effect systems, and is applicable in all cases in which the semantics can be given via enriched Lawvere theories. Our second main contribution is a demonstration that our theory accounts for the various aspects of Gifford-style effect systems. We begin with a version of Levy’s Call- by-push-value that includes algebraic effects. We add effect annotations, and design a general type-and-effect system for such call-by-push-value variants. The annotated language can be thought of as an intermediate representation used for program optimi- sation. We relate the unannotated semantics to the conservative restriction semantics, and establish the soundness of program transformations based on this effect analysis. We develop and classify a range of validated transformations, generalising many ex- isting ones and adding some new ones. We also give modularly-checkable sufficient conditions for the validity of these optimisations. In the final part of this thesis, we demonstrate our theory by analysing a simple example language involving global state with multiple regions, exceptions, and non- determinism. We give decision procedures for the applicability of the various effect- dependent transformations, and establish their soundness and completeness.},

  abstract = {By a standard complex we understand a complex of the following type: the complex first used by Eilenberg and ,MacLa.ne to define the cohomology of groups; the complex first used by Hochschild to defme the cohomology of an associative al- gebra (cf. [6] or [IO) ); the complexes introduced by And\& Barr and Beck in [ 1, 4.5). N those complexes are constructed according to a common pattern. We start with the foBowing data: A cotriple (comonad) C in a category A (which can be chosen to be small) and a set- or group-valued functor F on A. There is simplicial objet t X\_ = (X, , d’), a o ( where we drop the degeneracy operators) in the functor category AA, which is obtained from c by a standard construction due to Godement (cf. [ 8, appendice) ). Composing X. with the functor F we obtain a simplicial object FX\_ = (FX,, Fdi),ro in the functor category Ed or A@. in the latter case one usually considers the associated chain complex (and if the degeneracy operators are brought dong, sometimes its normalization), The resulting functorial complex is what we call a star\&ant txmpl\textasciitilde x. The aim of this paper is to construct standard complexes which are (homotopy) equivaien t to classical geometric complexes by using some simple arguments of ca- tegorical algebra. Moreover, we want to s!tow that the introduction of such standard complexes is useful by giving a few immediate applications leading in a natural way to classical results such as t.hlr: topologic4 iinvariance or’ simplicial homology for poly- hedra and de Rham’s theorem. I am indepted to Michael Barr and to Claude Auderset for many conversations which gave the paper its present form. The former pointed out to me the preprint of a paper by Rinehart [ B 21 in which singular and simplicial homology are treated as satellites relative to a pro,jective class, a paper which shaped the choice of the ap- plications presented here. He also knew of the cotriple E of Section 5 (without the help of Theorem 3.3). The latter observed that the double complexes in Sections 7 and \$ hapi-en to be isomorphic to the double complexes used by Weil in a classical proof of Leray’s theorem and of de Rham’s theorem (cf. f IS] ). It should be men- tioned, however, that our proofs are different from those of Weil insofar as we do not need to know the explicit form of those double complexes.}

  abstract = {The observation that universal algebra can be treated "in a coordinate free way", using monads, together with the observation that many tech niques available in the category of sets are available in any symmetric monoidal closed category V, makes it possible, by combined use of the monad language and the closed category language, to describe some of the elementary notions of universal algebra in an element-free way. Syntactically, such a description no longer has variables ranging over the set of elements in an algebra, but rather over the class of algebras itself. In particular, though the monad-theoretic treatment allows for infinitary algebras, the notions formulated here are all formulated in a finitary way. For example, one can formulate the notion of "algebra, where every operation is a homomorphism with respect to any operation". This was done in [3], [4], and [5], The notion to be described here is that of a "function in two vari ables which is a homomorphism in each variable separately." This concept of "bilinearity" is used in the main Section 2, which deals with cartesian closed categories. The main theorem is Theorem 2.6 which says that a monad on a cartesian closed category, whose functor part commutes with products satisfies: (i) it carries a unique structure as strong monad; and (ii) this structure makes the monad commutative in the sense of [3]; and (iii) the category of algebras for it is cartesian closed. Monads of this kind we call cartesian closed (Definition 2.7). They can also be characterized as commutative monads for which a map "is bi linear if and only if it is linear" (Theorem 2.5). The two implications in this "if and only if" are investigated separately in Theorem 2.1 and Proposition 2.3, the first describing the notion of "affine monad".}

(The terms ‘Closed Category’ etc. are from the paper [2] by Eilenberg and Kelly). In particular, the monad itself is a ‘closed monad’; this fact was also proved in [4].},

Software models can often be formalized as objects of presheaf topoi, i.e, categories of objects that can be represented as algebras as well as coalgebras, e.g., the category of directed graphs. Multimodeling requires to construct colimits of models, decomposition is given by pullback. Compositionality requires an exact interplay of these operations, i.e., diagrams must enjoy the Van Kampen property. However, checking the validity of the Van Kampen property algorithmically based on its definition is often impossible. In this paper we state a necessary and sufficient yet efficiently checkable condition for the Van Kampen property to hold in presheaf topoi. It is based on a uniqueness property of path-like structures within the defining congruence classes that make up the colimiting cocone of the models. We thus add to the statement "Being Van Kampen is a Universal Property" by Heindel and Soboci\textbackslash '\{n\}ski the fact that the Van Kampen property reveals a presheaf-based structural uniqueness feature.},

With proper abstractions, solutions to hard problems can be expressed concisely, thus making them more likely to be found. In this paper, we propose Learning Mathematical Abstractions (LEMMA): an algorithm that implements this idea for reinforcement learning agents in mathematical domains. LEMMA augments Expert Iteration with an abstraction step, where solutions found so far are revisited and rewritten in terms of new higher-level actions, which then become available to solve new problems. We evaluate LEMMA on two mathematical reasoning tasks--equation solving and fraction simplification--in a step-by-step fashion. In these two domains, LEMMA improves the ability of an existing agent, both solving more problems and generalizing more effectively to harder problems than those seen during training.},

  abstract = {Relevance logics are non-classical logics. Called ‘relevant logics’ in Britain and Australasia, these systems developed as attempts to avoid the paradoxes of material and strict implication. These so-called paradoxes are valid conclusions that follow from the definitions of material and strict implication but are seen, by some, as problematic. For example, the material implication (p→q) is true whenever p is false or q is true — i.e., (¬p∨q). So if p is true, then the material implication is true when q is true. Among the paradoxes of material implication are the following: p→(q→p),¬p→(p→q),(p→q)∨(q→r). The first asserts that every proposition implies a true one; the second that a false proposition implies every proposition, and the third that for any three propositions, either the first implies the second or the second implies the third. Similarly, the strict implication (p→q) is true whenever it is not possible that p is true and q is false — i.e., ¬⋄(p\&¬q) . Among the paradoxes of strict implication are the following: (p\&¬p)→q,p→(q→q),p→(q∨¬q). The first asserts that a contradiction strictly implies every proposition; the second and third imply that every proposition strictly implies a tautology. Many philosophers, beginning with Hugh MacColl (1908), have claimed that these theses are counterintuitive. They claim that these formulae fail to be valid if we interpret → as representing the concept of implication that we have before we learn classical logic. Relevance logicians claim that what is unsettling about these so-called paradoxes is that in each of them the antecedent seems irrelevant to the consequent. In addition, relevance logicians have had qualms about certain inferences that classical logic makes valid. For example, consider the classically valid inference     The moon is made of green cheese. Therefore, either it is raining in Ecuador now or it is not.  Again here there seems to be a failure of relevance. The conclusion seems to have nothing to do with the premise. Relevance logicians have attempted to construct logics that reject theses and arguments that commit “fallacies of relevance”.}

These new features are provided in a principled fashion by extending the classical first-order theory of Horn clauses to the intuitionistic higher-order theory of hereditary Harrop formulas. The justification for considering this extension a satisfactory logic programming language is provided through the proof-theoretic notion of a uniform proof. The correspondence between each extension to Prolog and the new features in the stronger logical theory is discussed. Also discussed are various aspects of an experimental implementation of λ-Prolog.}

In this paper we study structural properties under which \$T\$ preserves equations between those operations. It has already been shown that any monoidal monad preserves linear equations; affine monads preserve drop equations (where some variable appears only on one side, such as \$x\textbackslash cdot y = y\$) and relevant monads preserve dup equations (where some variable is duplicated, such as \$x \textbackslash cdot x = x\$). We start the paper by showing a converse: if the monad at hand preserves a drop equation, then it must be affine. From this, we show that the problem whether a given (drop) equation is preserved is undecidable. A converse for relevance turns out to be more subtle: preservation of certain dup equations implies a weaker notion which we call \$n\$-relevance. Finally, we identify the subclass of equations such that their preservation is equivalent to relevance.},

We show on a set of unseen proofs, REFACTOR is able to extract 19.6\% of the theorems that humans would use to write the proofs. When applying the model to the existing Metamath library, REFACTOR extracted 16 new theorems which are used frequently in the Metamath library, with an average usage of 733.5 times. With newly extracted theorems, we show that the existing proofs in the MetaMath database can be refactored to shorten the proof lengths. Lastly, we demonstrate that the prover trained on the new-theorem refactored dataset is able to prove more test theorems.},

  abstract = {Proof planning [4] is an approach to theorem proving which encodes heuristics for constructing mathematical proofs in a meta-theory of methods. The Clam system, developed at Edinburgh [3], has been used for several years to develop proof planning, in particular proof plans for induction. It has become clear that many of the theorem-proving tasks that we would like to perform are naturally higher-order. For example, an important technique called middle-out reasoning [6] uses meta-variables to stand for some unknown objects in a proof, to be instantiated as the proof proceeds. Domains such as the synthesis and  verification of software and hardware systems, and techniques such as proof critics [7], benefit greatly from such middle-out reasoning. Since in these domains the meta-variables often become instantiated with terms of function type, reasoning with them is naturally higher-order, and higher-order unification is a vital tool. One of our motivations for studying induction is that it is an important technique for reasoning about programs. Reasoning about programs (functions, predicates) is naturally higher-order, and although it is possible to reason about such objects in a first-order meta-theory, in order to do so we would have to modify our existing Clam methods to deal with proper treatment of A bindings, (3 reduction etc. The reasoning is much clearer if we use higher-order logic as the meta-theory. XClam is a higher-order prototype of Clam, written in XProlog, a higher- order version of Prolog. The meta-theory is based on higher-order logic, which simplifies reasoning about higher-order objects and allows many of the proof plans developed in Clam to be transferred to the higher-order setting without significant modifications. This is important because Clam constitutes a  significant knowledge base for (inductive) proof. The use of AProlog gives us a powerful meta-theory which allows methods to be written concisely and declaratively,  further enhancing one of the advantages of proof planning which is that it produces plans which are understandable to the human user.As well as being able to prove higher-order theorems which Clam cannot, LambdaClam is also capable of proving many first-order theorems.},

  abstract = {Quillen’s model structures axiomatize a general framework for homotopy theory, providing tools to study the objects of a category up to some specified notion of weak equivalence. In a model cat- egory, the interactions between the weak equivalences and two additional classes of morphisms— the cofibrations and the fibrations—enable a concrete construction of the homotopy category; the category obtained by restricting to the fibrant-cofibrant objects and taking homotopy classes of maps is equivalent to the formal localization at the weak equivalences. Furthermore, model struc- tures enable one to perform constructions at the “point-set level”—i.e., in the original category, which typically has more limits and colimits than the homotopy category—that are homotopically meaningful in the sense that they agree with their derived functors. For these reasons, model categories have proliferated far beyond the original topological set- ting. But despite their popularity, ordinary model structures only provide a context for homotopy theory and don’t contribute directly to calculations. In this thesis we present a new, more rigid, algebraic extension of Quillen’s notion that has this calculational capacity because certain struc- tures previously only supposed to exist are now specified. This thesis lays the foundations for the theory of algebraic model structures, introducing a number of basic definitions, describing conditions that give rise to important examples, and discussing general features. Algebraic model structures, introduced in Part I of this thesis, provide a setting for homotopy theory in which the trappings of an ordinary model structure—the cofibrations, fibrations, trivial cofibrations, and trivial fibrations—can be thought of algebraically: as maps together with extra data witnessing their membership in the particular class. Each algebraic model structure deter- mines an underlying ordinary model category, in the sense of Quillen [Qui67], but one whose functorial factorizations have richer algebraic structure. Despite the fact that this new definition is much stricter than the original, an algebraic model structure exists whenever an ordinary model structure is cofibrantly generated. The abundance of such examples means that this theory offers a new perspective on classical model categories, which we believe will be of interest to experts, even if they see no immediate need for the algebraic structures we can guarantee. What does it mean to consider fibrations algebraically? A classical example is provided by the Hurewicz fibrations, which can be characterized as those maps of spaces that admit a path lifting viii function. Importantly, a path lifting function assigned to some map p is precisely an algebra structure for p with respect to a particular monad on the arrow category, whose objects are maps of spaces and whose morphisms are commutative squares [May75]. The monad is constructed from the Moore paths monad and describes, among other things, a functorial factorization of each arrow as a cofibration and homotopy equivalence followed by a fibration. The monad on the arrow category is the functor that replaces a map by a fibration, its right factor. Furthermore, the functor that sends a map to its left factor with respect to this functorial factorization, the trivial cofibration part, is itself a comonad on the arrow category. Its coalgebras are necessarily homotopy equivalences and Hurewicz cofibrations. Furthermore, the coalgebra structure assigned to a particular trivial cofibration can be used to construct a canonical solution to any lifting problem against a fibration equipped with a path lifting function. These are the general features of what it means to describe the trivial cofibrations and fibrations as “algebraic”: such maps are equipped with specified retractions to their left or right factors which can be used to solve all lifting problems. In an algebraic model structure, both functorial factorizations have this flavor: the right fac- tors are monads and the left factors are comonads. Algebras are necessarily fibrations and trivial fibrations, and coalgebras are necessarily trivial cofibrations and cofibrations, respectively. Addi- tionally, a natural comparison between the two functorial factorizations induces functors that map algebraic trivial cofibrations to algebraic cofibrations and algebraic trivial fibrations to algebraic trivial fibrations. These functors compatibly assign a canonical solution to any lifting problem between an algebraic trivial cofibration and an algebraic trivial fibration. The data of an algebraic model structure determines a fibrant replacement monad and cofi- brant replacement comonad; algebras and coalgebras are algebraic fibrant objects and algebraic cofibrant objects. Furthermore, the canonical solution to a particular lifting problem defines a distributive law of the monad over the comonad, which specifies the algebraic fibrant-cofibrant objects. Future work will explore the implications of the previously unnoticed fact that any cofi- brantly generated model category has a fibrant replacement monad and cofibrant replacement comonad, which, in particular, allows one to construct (co)simplicial resolutions using point-set derived functors. A paradigmatic cofibrantly generated algebraic model structure is Quillen’s original model structure on spaces, generated by the sets I = \{S n−1 → Dn\} and J = \{Dn → Dn × I\}. An algebraic fibration is a Serre fibration equipped with chosen lifts of cylinders in the base space ix extending specified disks in the total space. An algebraic trivial fibration is a map equipped with lifted contractions filling spheres in the total space which are contractible in the base. Such maps are necessarily both Serre fibrations and weak homotopy equivalences; that is, they are necessarily trivial fibrations in the underlying ordinary model structure. Conversely, all trivial fibrations admit some algebra structure: one need only make a choice among the various fillers for such spheres which necessarily exist. Indeed, whenever the algebraic model structure is cofibrantly generated, all fibrations and all trivial fibrations are algebraic. Interestingly, the dual statements do not hold: the cofibrations and trivial cofibrations need not admit coalgebra structures, even when the algebraic model structure is cofibrantly generated. Accordingly, we say a cofibration is cellular if it admits a coalgebra structure, that is, if there is some algebraic cofibration with this underlying map. The name is motivated by the most familiar example: a relative cell complex is a map of spaces, necessarily a cofibration, that can be described by repeatedly attaching cells to the domain. Such a description is called a cellular decomposition for the map and defines a coalgebra structure for the comonad. By convention, whenever two cells can be attached “at the same time” in a particular cellular decomposition, we do so, so that the filtration defined by the cellular decomposition will have fewer, in fact typically only countably many, stages. As is familiar for CW-complexes, a special case, the resulting coalgebra structures are not at all unique, even granting this convention. Not all cofibrations for this model structure are cellular. The best one can say is that the cofibrations are retracts of relative cell complexes, that is, retracts of cellular cofibrations. Analo- gously, in any algebraic model category, any cofibration is a retract of a cellular one. More specif- ically, any cofibration is a retract of a cofibration admitting a free coalgebra structure, namely, its left factor in the cofibration–trivial fibration factorization. For some algebraic model structures, the cellular cofibrations behave quite differently. For example, in Quillen’s model structure on simplicial sets, generated by the sphere and horn in- clusions, every cofibration is cellular and furthermore admits a unique coalgebra structure. Here the cofibrations are precisely the monomorphisms and the filtration defined by their cellular de- composition is always countable. The first step attaches all simplices whose boundary appears in the domain. In particular this includes all 0-simplices of the codomain. The second step attaches all simplices whose boundary is present at the end of stage one; in particular, this includes all 1-simplices. In this way, we see that the n-th simplicial set of the resulting filtration contains at least the (n − 1)-skeleton of the codomain. x When comparing algebraic model structures on different categories, cellularity is more than just a curiosity. A cellularity condition precisely characterizes algebraic Quillen adjunctions, a rigid analog of the classical notion. In an ordinary Quillen adjunction, the left adjoint preserves the (trivial) cofibrations and the right adjoint preserves the (trivial) fibrations. In an algebraic Quillen adjunction, a new definition introduced below, the left adjoint lifts to a functor between the algebraic (trivial) cofibrations and the right adjoint lifts to a functor between the algebraic (trivial) fibrations, and furthermore these lifts determine each other, in a sense that is rather del- icate to make precise. Modulo a compatibility condition which is not the main point, an adjunc- tion is an algebraic Quillen adjunction if and only if the images of the generating cofibrations and trivial cofibrations under the left adjoint are cellular with respect to the appropriate comonads. Furthermore, a choice of cell structures completely determines the lifted functors and hence the full algebraic Quillen adjunction. The geometric realization–total singular complex adjunction between simplicial sets and spaces is a member of a large class of examples. The geometric realizations of the generat- ing cofibrations are homeomorphic to the elements of the set I; we assign these maps the sim- plest possible I-cellular structures. Similarly, the geometric realizations of the horn inclusions are homeomorphic to the elements of J; again, we assign these maps the simplest J-cellular structures. In this case, the naturality condition, glossed over above, demands a good choice of I-cellular structures for the realizations of the horn inclusions: first attach the “missing face” to the geometrically realized horn to make a sphere, and then fill the sphere. The theme of cellularity, entirely present but not fully apparent to the author in Part I [Rie11], is unmistakable in Part II, which introduces monoidal algebraic model structures, algebraicizing the definition of [Hov99]. Extending the results for the single-variable case, algebraic Quillen two-variable adjunctions exist precisely when the pushout-products of the generating cofibrations and trivial cofibrations are cellular; furthermore, these cellular structures completely determine the algebraic Quillen two-variable adjunctions. The main technical work of Part II is to precisely state the definition of an algebraic Quillen two-variable adjunction and prove these theorems, which are much harder than the single-variable versions, but once this technical work is complete, the definition of a monoidal algebraic model structure is apparent. Monoidal model structures necessarily precede consideration of enriched ones but also inherit nearly all of their complexity, so the definition of an enriched algebraic model structure is also evident. However, we leave this topic for another paper where we have time to more fully consider examples. xi In order to state the definitions and prove the theorems appearing in this thesis, we had to develop a fair amount of pure category theory. The precise definition of an algebraic Quillen ad- junction proved particularly fruitful, requiring a new notion of morphism between the categorical components of an algebraic model structure. Our discovery of the correct notion was motivated by a desire to replicate the classical situation where a Quillen adjunction can be detected by con- sidering the left adjoint and the (trivial) cofibrations or the right adjoint and the (trivial) fibrations alone. Alternatively, these definitions can be intuited from a purely categorical lens. The compo- nents of an algebraic Quillen adjunction are lax morphisms of monads and colax morphisms of comonads related by the calculus of mates [KS74], which governs the interactions between the monads and comonads arising from the same functorial factorization. An alternate approach uses the fact that the (co)algebra structures assigned to a composable pair of (co)fibrations are themselves composable in such a way that the algebraic (co)fibrations become a double category; algebraic Quillen adjunctions consist of compatible lifted double functors. In fact, the main reason the proofs in Part II are much harder than the corresponding arguments in Part I is that the functors between arrow categories arising from a two-variable adjunction do not preserve composability of underlying maps, much less (co)algebras. Thus, in the two-variable case, we are forced to rely upon the mates approach, but even here the necessary category theory does not exist. To describe the correct correspondence between the three lifted functors of an algebraic two-variable adjunction, we introduce parameterized mates and prove a few fundamental lemmas. In this paper, we consider only two-variable adjunctions, the case of interest, but the same ideas extend to n-variable adjunctions and can be used to define the 2- cells of a category object in the category of multicategories of a particular sort. Of all the topics developed here, we believe this to be of greatest independent categorical interest.},

  abstract = {The categorical approach to recursion theory has produced very interesting results in such areas as the study of higher-type structure [Hyl77b, Sco80a, LS83] (the last contains also references to earlier work) and the study of models of computation [Sco82, Plo85]. The theory concentrates on the idea of ”com- putation” but often discards ”effectiveness”, although this notion should be represented in the theory: any mechanizable computation is certainly effective. Consequently, it is also necessary to represent the possibility of failure: a computation may diverge on some input. Therefore, it seems to be an inescapable conclusion that the theory must include a notion of partiality. At the present time, the development of the categorical approach to effectiveness presents two major directions: one focuses on Erˇsov’s category of enumerated sets and the study of its full subcategories (cf. [Smy77, Vis80, LM84c]). The essential structure of effectivity is determined by the maps rather than by the objects: a map f : \{an\}n∈N {$>$} \{bn\}n∈N between two enumerated sets is a function between the indexed sets such that the equation f(an) = bg(n) holds for some recursive function g. Many elementary facts of recursion theory can be expressed as properties of particular objects of the category. But, in order to study particular structures, one often has to refer back to the set N of indices, resulting in a rather heavy use of notation, and the main effort in proofs is usually concentrated in showing that some constructed set is an enumerated set. The other approach rejects altogether the idea that objects have to be enumerated in order to be given some effective structure, and it insists instead on having effectiveness as an internal feature of the whole universe. Rather than structuring sets with enumerations in the classical universe, one considers sets in an intuitionistic universe where a property such as “all functions on the set of natural numbers are recursive” may hold. The first example of this idea is the realizability model of [Kle45] (cf. [Tro73, McC84]), but it found its category-theoretic setting in [Hyl82] where the effective topos F is introduced. The effective topos has many desirable properties: the functions on the natural numbers are all recursive (Church’s Thesis), and the ω-Axiom of Choice and Markov’s Principle hold. Also, the category of enumerated sets is fully embedded in the effective topos as is the category PER of partial equivalence relations on the applicative structure on N. Martin Hyland and Eugenio Moggi announced that the interrnal full subcategory on stable quotients on N (the internal version of PER) is closed under internal arbitrary limits, a result suggesting very interesting developments in the theory of polymorphic types. Concerning the abstract theory of partiality, categories of partial maps appeared as examples of monoidal categories which were iatroduced by [EK66], but the main interest of the theory concerned categories of modules over a ring, and no real development of a theory for partiality came at that time. Much later [PH86] reconsidered the problem. In a series of lectures in Siena in 1984, they presented dominical categories in order to give a basic category-theoretic setting for an abstract study of recursion theory. At the same time, Gordon Plotkin made explicit the reason why Scott-continuous functions between complete partial orders are partial: his method was simply to remove the bottom element (which represents the ”undefined” va]ue) from each complete partial order, and consider what is left of the continuons functions between them. A first acconnt of a general category-theoretic treatment of this idea was considered by [LM84a], who drew categorical intuitions from the work of DiPaola and Heller. We are convinced that in a treatment of computations it is convenient and instructive to have an intuitionist’s attitude. Support for this approach rests on many works on intuitionistic mathematics. The work of this thesis is particularly influenced by the approach advocated by Dana Scott and his 6 Introduction collaborators [Sco79, Sco80b, Fou80, Gra79, McC84, Hyl82]. Our approach makes strong use of topos theory, which we think is the best expression of the link between category theory and intuitionism. Cat- egory theory has to do with closure properties of families of maps and with the characterization of maps and spaces in terms of mapping properties. Definability of these map is often important. Intuitionistic logic treats existence in terms of explicit constructions; hence, definability is again important. The conservative translation of category theory into intuitionistic logic makes the harmony between these theories precise. As we remarked, intuitionistic logic has models in which maps on the natural numbers are always computable (again, this is a kind of definability), so we combine under one point of view both algebraic explicitness and computational notions. An important question that has to be answered concerns the treatment of partiality in an intuitionistic world. We found an answer when we proved a representation theorem for dominical categories: every dominical category is a full subcategory of a category of partial maps on a topos [Ros85]. One can paraphrase this result as follows: every dominical category is a category of sets and partial functions. In the proof of that result it became clear how an intuitionist could choose to define partial functions: select a subset Σ of the set Ω of truth-values such that the truth-value true ∈ Σ, and accept as partial functions those whose domains of definition are classified by Σ. By this we mean that a partial function ϕ : X ⇀ Y is accepted if and only if ∀x ∈ X.|x ∈ dom ϕ| ∈ Σ. In order to obtain a category of partial functions, Σ must satisfy the further condition that p ∈ Σ ∧ [p = true → q ∈ Σ] → (p ∧ q) ∈ Σ With a questionable choice of name, we call such an object a dominance, because it classifies the domains of the partial functions. A final word about specializing these considerations to the classical case: in the topos S of classical sets, the two possible choices for a dominance give rise eactly to the two categories of total functions and of partial functions on sets. The interesting choices of dominance are found in non-Boolean topoi. For instance, in the effective topos F we can consider the set of truth-values which answer a recursive question: Σ = \{p ∈ Ω : ∃f ∈ NN.p ↔ (∃z ∈ N.f(z) = O)\}. This is a dominance. In F, all functions on the natural numbers are recursive, and the request f(z) = O represents a generic recursive statement. (We first saw this definition in a lecture by Dana Scott in Pisa in the fall of 1983). We argue beginning in Chapter 5 that properties of Σ make the relation between continuity and effectiveness of functions apparent. We discuss the study of the known models for computation and elaborate on their mutual relationships, in order to discuss the usefulness of having a universal notion of ”recursively enumerable”. In Chapter 8 we gather ideas from the results we obtain about the models to explain a possible synthetic approach to the theory of computation. To sustain our arguments in favour of such an approach, we must first explain the elementary theory for partial maps. To the best of our knowledge, what we present is original, and we compare it to the literature already available. In particular, in the generality of our treatment, we can answer some open questions presented in [PH86]. We then continue by presenting the general theory of dominance. We do not wish to claim that this is the way it has to be done. But, it is certainly very simple; it includes all the other theories; it has straightforward applications to some important categories of partial maps. We already explained that we are convinced that the use of this notion when looking at the models considerably helps intuition. And there is a very clear sense in which a dominance gives rise to continuity of functionals. In Chapter 1 we review the logical expressive power in a topos and discuss connected problems in Grothendieck topoi. In Chapter 2 we introduce p-categories as an abstraction of categories of partial maps and prove a completeness result for these. We compare our definition to others from the literature, consider a few common constructions of category theory in the context of p-categories, and solve some problems posed in [PH86] about stability of ranges and coproducts.},

Our second goal is to generalize this result to enriched categories and homotopy weighted limits, showing that the classical explicit constructions still give the right answer in the abstract sense. This result partially bridges the gap between classical homotopy theory and modern abstract homotopy theory. To do this we introduce a notion of "enriched homotopical categories", which are more general than enriched model categories, but are still a good place to do enriched homotopy theory. This demonstrates that the presence of enrichment often simplifies rather than complicates matters, and goes some way toward achieving a better understanding of "the role of homotopy in homotopy theory."},

  abstract = {In this section, we initially work over a base topos Set; all of our  constructions apply in a context where we work over a Grothendieck  topos E as base. Later in this section, we take E to be the topos  of Joyal species.  Classically, bar constructions have been used to build classifying  bundles, free resolutions for group cohomology, and similar constructs.  A common characteristic between these constructions is the production of  an acyclic algebraic structure (e.g., a contractible G-space EG, or  a free resolution of a G-module). We begin by formalizing this  characteristic in terms of a universal property for bar constructions.},

  abstract = {Refactoring is an important Software Engineering technique for improving the structure of a program after it has been written. Refactorings improve the maintainability, readability, and design of a program without affecting its external behaviour. In analogy, this thesis introduces proof refactoring to make structured, semantics preserving changes to the proof documents constructed by interactive theorem provers as part of a formal proof development. In order to formally study proof refactoring, the first part of this thesis constructs a proof language framework, Hiscript. The Hiscript framework consists of a procedural tactic language, a declarative proof language, and a modular theory language. Each level of this framework is equipped with a formal semantics based on a hierarchical notion of proof trees. Furthermore, this framework is generic as it does not prescribe an underlying logical kernel. This part contributes an investigation of semantics for formal proof documents, which is proved to construct valid proofs. Moreover, in analogy with type-checking, static well-formedness checks of proof documents are separated from evaluation of the proof. Furthermore, a subset of the SSReflect language for Coq, called eSSence, is also encoded using hierarchical proofs. Both Hiscript and eSSence are shown to have language elements with a natural hierarchical representation. In the second part, proof refactoring is put on a formal footing with a definition using the Hiscript framework. Over thirty refactorings are formally specified and proved to preserve the semantics in a precise way for the Hiscript language, including traditional structural refactorings, such as rename item, and proof specific refactorings such as backwards proof to forwards proof and declarative to procedural. Finally, a concrete, generic refactoring framework, called Polar, is introduced. Polar is based on graph rewriting and has been implemented with over ten refactorings and for two proof languages, including Hiscript. Finally, the third part concludes with some wishes for the future.},

Learning is based on traces of successful proof attempts: we will use inductive logic programming (ILP) [5] to learn Prolog programs that can reproduce (some repetitive parts of) the proofs found. Such programs are then incorporated into the next iteration of the prover as new actions, resulting in a hierarchy of more advanced provers.},

  abstract = {We present a reinforcement learning toolkit for experiments with guiding automated theorem proving in the connection calculus. The core of the toolkit is a compact and easy to extend Prolog-based automated theorem prover called plCoP. plCoP builds on the leanCoP Prolog implementation and adds learning-guided Monte-Carlo Tree Search as done in the rlCoP system. Other components include a Python interface to plCoP and machine learners, and an external proof checker that verifies the validity of plCoP proofs. The toolkit is evaluated on two benchmarks and we demonstrate its extendability by two additions: (1) guidance is extended to reduction steps and (2) the standard leanCoP calculus is extended with rewrite steps and their learned guidance. We argue that the Prolog setting is suitable for combining statistical and symbolic learning methods. The complete toolkit is publicly released.},
